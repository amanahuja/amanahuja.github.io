    "content": "We imagine each resource, each technology and data initiative, as progressing through phases. A biological metaphor might speak about conception and adolesence, to adult maturation, and then death and even beyond death. \n\nActual initiatives are not linear, but messy and complex and iterative. So, let's extend our mental image from one initiative to many, to hundreds. At any given moment there are many initiatives -- and potential initiatives and past initiatives -- at the same time, at each phase of this life cycle. \n\nThen for all these together and across the sector, we can speak about: \n\n**Innovation and Creation**<br/>\nWhat does it take to innovate new approaches to big problems, to recognize successes, and to develop a vision? To even articulate the challenge, map the system and the problem space, and to identifying causes and effects and levers? What organiations and methods will support the synthesis of existing ideas, programs, and resources? *How can we support the creation of new public goods?*\n\n**Sustain and Improve**<br/>\nA good deal is written about sustaining and maintaining organizations and their impact, on measuring and evaluation, and responsible ways to scale or the choice to not scale at all. Yet data initiatives in civil society have a terrible track record in this regard, not just because of funding challenges. What changes must be made and what conditions might a society create addresses these issues? What organizations currently focus on this issue, and what other organizations are missing?\n\n**Retire and Reuse**<br/>\nThere is great need to address end-of-life concerns -- what happens to assets, data, knowledge and learnings when funding runs out? How can we keep data from being as a pesticide, causing unforeseen negative outcomes downstream? There's great opportunity to amplify cross-sector learnings outside of the research publications. \n\n\nA vision for such a healthy life cycle in the sector is about doing this not just once, but improving our capacity at every phase, to be able to achieve repeated, consistent, and ever-improving successes. \n\nWhich frameworks and organizations, for example, are excellent at improving our capacity to innovate and to discover new approaches\n\nThe full life cycle of data initiatives in civil society is not given sufficient consideration. Often the focus is only on innovation, and the first public release. There's an assumption that users and stakeholders will see value in the tool and choose to perform occasional updates, and that's sufficient. \n\nThis lack of attention to full life cycle is emblematic of broader issues:\n* Funding and programs favor MVPs and pilots over meaningul and sustained impact\n* Lack of knowledge retention, few reusable assets, and work repeated on the same challenges. \n* Strategic and long-term thinking is de-prioritized, or is disjoint between the organization(s) and the technology and data initiative. \n\nInspiration: \n* Fabriders [life cycle of network-centric resources](https://www.fabriders.net/network-centric-resources-lifecycle/)",

Can we simply do what we have been doing elsewhere, now with civil society organizations? Can we not utilize, with a few adjustments, those tools, skills, and methods that we created for such initiatives in other problem-spaces?\n\nI'm talking about the technical infrastructures, the agile methodologies and the coding practices. The product mindset, the user-centered design, the way we structure our teams. The funding ideas will be different, that's clear, and some legal frameworks, but that _feels_ not so relevant to the data problems themselves. \n\nIn fact, there are really important differences between a civil society data initiatives and those at a for-profit organization, or one run by the government. And these differences require that we evaluate carefully any direct application of familiar tools or methods, and that, in fact, we may need to build new approaches entirely. \n\nAnd this understanding -- that civil society is different, that the problems it tries to solve are different, that the values and principles we need to carry in its work are different, and that together we have to really identify these differences and plan for them -- this undertanding allows us to see the whole sector with new perspective, one that is not just wary of pitfalls but is also full of fresh [ideas and opportunities](opportunities.md).\n\n{{<pullquote >}}\nThis understanding allows us to see the whole sector with new perspective, one that is not just wary of pitfalls, but also full of fresh ideas and opportunities and a renewed promise. \n{{< /pullquote >}}\n\nI have described a few of the differences below, with examples, to illustrate how these differences can impact the design, the team composition, the sustainability, and the impact of the tool or product.  \n   \n#### Multi-stakeholder teams\nCivil society data initiatives are often multi-team collaborative efforts with a complexity of incentives and power-dynamics. \n\nOne [US county that we worked with](/portfolio/recidivism-data-sharing/) was aware that understanding recidivism requires bringing together information from many organizations. An individual's interactions with the justice system over time may include the Sheriff's office, the courts, prison, the probation office, community based organizations (CBOs) and more. Whether or not they recidivate, they may encounter many of these multiple times. \n\nThese are all organizations that are part of the same system, the justice system, and they frequently interact with one another. They even have common goals -- such as to reduce recidivism. So in a broad sense, there is a shared incentive to bring their data together So in a broad sense, there is a shared incentive to bring their data together. \n\nAnd yet, there are good reasons why they may hesitate from cooperating. These organizations often have conflicting incentives as well. A public defender can be described as both coordinating with and at odds with the district attorney. A community based organization may have information about a program participant that they would not want to share with their probation officer. \n\nThe county justice system _as a whole_ may benefit from better understanding how individuals traverse the justice system, how to improve interventions, to see how recidivism rates have changed over time and what programs lead to improved outcomes. Pooling their siloed data may help make better decisions about these programs, and might help identify problems in the system that could be addressed. \n\nBut who would get all that data? How will it be used, and who will decide how to use it? How can we ensure that such a system would be used for the benefit of the community, and not against it? \n\nConsider\n* Unequal power dynamics\n* Alignining on objectives\n\n##### The user, the data principal and the stakeholders\n\nConsider these definitions: \n* The *user* is the individual interacting with the tool or product, for whom a user interface has been created. \n* The *data principal* or subject is the persons or entities that are described by the data, or who are directly affected by the decisions and actions enabled by the tool.\n* The *stakeholders* are many, but include the funder and other vested organizations. \n\nFor a data product at, say, NetFlix, we might say that: I am the user, since I select and watch the movie; I am the data principal, since data is collected about my preferences and those of other users; and I am the funder, since I pay the monthly subscription to the NetFlix company. \n\nIn the recidivism example above, these entities are not the same. Although this happens in all sectors, the nature of work in civil society makes this common or default case.  And for these organizations, for instance NGOs working with refugees or journalists investigating corrpution, this dynamic leads to threat models, governance challenges, and design patterns that are more important and challenging. \n\n> \"User-centered design\" and other approaches in a _product mindset_ must be applied carefully or rebuilt entirely in such contexts. \n\n\n##### Rethinking the role of data\nThe purpose or role of data in the project may be fundamentally different\n\n##### Data, truth and reality\nData sources must be treated as imperfect representations of reality\n\n##### Funding, sustainability, and the project lifecycle\nHave different funding and sustainability models than we see in the private and public sectors.\n\n\nWith these \n[Unique Challenges](challenges.md)\n[Opportunities and Aspirations](opportunities.md)\n[Building Capacity](building_capacity.md)",

    "content": "The term *civil society* refers to the \"third leg\" of society, along with the private sector, and the public sector. \n\nCivil society is considered inclusive of academia, journalists, religious groups, NGOs, and importantly, activists and nonprofits. \n\n> Note: The term \"civic sector\" is used to refer to things related to the government, which can be confusing; here we are referring to *civil* and not *civic*. \n\nOne one hand, independence between these sectors can be critical, and provides an important **counterbalance** in society. That's why we might care if a newspaper is owned by a nation-state, or if an alleged public good is provided by a for profit corporation.\n\nOn the other hand, many important initiatives involve relationships that span these boundaries. We might talk about \"public-private partnerships\" and similar. Government and corporations increasingly fund these  organizations, and we increasingly look to philanthropy rooted in the private sector for creating and supporting public goods. New types of organizations sit intentionally between the sectors. **The boundaries between these sectors can be fuzzy**, and is getting fuzzier.\n\nMy energy is focused on civil society (and on collaborations where a civil society org plays a central role) because *civil society is really important*.\n* The civil sector carries many of our democratic values, and ideas that make society safer, fairer and more just. \n* Civil society resists centralized control and expoloitative profiteering, and supports efforts that do the same. \n* An eroding civil society is a sign of an unhealthy country -- and indicates a lack of desire or ability to participate, reduced check-and-balances on power, and greater apathy for marginalized communities. \n\nMost organizations in civil society inreasingly operate in digital spaces and would be more effective through the use of data and technology -- as discussed by Lucy Bernholz and the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford. \n\nThis creates many problems, and also many great [opportunities](opportunities.md), ways in which organizations will be more successful, more able to support their communities, through the  use of data. And this has hope of strengthening our society as whole.\n\nI have worked with many such organizations that are struggling to use data effectively, and responsibly. I've seen civil society initiatives attempt to build data-centric tools that are centered in civil society values, and not merely transplants, or short-lived donations, from tech-savvy private sector companies. We've sought ways of making our work resilient, financially sustainable, and appropriately governed. \n\nImportant factors make data initiatives in civil society very different from government projects or for-profit products --> [So what's different about civil society data initiatives?](whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives). New approaches and expertise must be developed to meet these challenges and opportunities.\n\nThese aren't problems to be solved, so much as issues to be managed, and some guiding principles. **Recognizable patterns** emerge, which can be seen in the sector as a whole, and by individual organizations and teams, that suggest ways in which we can think usefully about how to better builders, better funders and supporter, and better participants in these initiatives.\n\nReferences and Recommended Reading: \n* Lucy Bernholz, [\"Civil Society as the Immune System for Democracy\"](https://philanthropy.blogspot.com/2018/01/civil-society-as-immune-system-for.html) (2018).",
