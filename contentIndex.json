    "title": "Why is civil society important?",
    "content": "The term *civil society* refers to the \"third leg\" of society, along with the private sector, and the public sector. \n\nCivil society is considered inclusive of academia, journalists, religious groups, NGOs, and importantly, activists and nonprofits. \n\n\u003e Note: The term \"civic sector\" is used to refer to things related to the government, which can be confusing; here we are referring to *civil* and not *civic*. \n\nOne one hand, independence between these sectors can be critical, and provides an important **counterbalance** in society. That's why we might care if a newspaper is owned by a nation-state, or if an alleged public good is provided by a for profit corporation.\n\nOn the other hand, many important initiatives involve **partnerships between the three sectors**, and thus we often talk about \"public-private partnerships\" and similar.  New types of organizations sit intentionally between the sectors, with unclear outcomes. We increasingly look to philanthropy rooted in the private sector for public goods. The boundaries between sectors case can be fuzzy, and is getting fuzzier, both for better and for worse.\n\nMy energy is focused on civil society (and on collaborations where a civil society org plays a central role) because *civil society is really important*.\n* The civil sector carries many of our democratic values, and ideas that make society safer, fairer and more just. \n* Civil society resists centralized control and expoloitative profiteering, and supports efforts that do the same. \n* An eroding civil society is a sign of an unhealthy country -- and indicates a lack of desire or ability to participate, reduced check-and-balances on power, and greater apathy for marginalized communities. \n\nMost organizations in civil society inreasingly operate in digital spaces and would be more effective through the use of data and technology -- as discussed by Lucy Bernholz and the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford. \n\nI have worked with many such organizations that are struggling to use data effectively, and responsibly. I've seen civil society initiatives attempt to build data-centric tools that are centered in civil society values, and not merely transplants, or short-lived donations, from tech-savvy private sector companies. We've sought ways of making our work resilient, financially sustainable, and appropriately governed. \n\nImportant factors make data initiatives in civil society very different from government projects or for-profit products --\u003e [So what's different about civil society data initiatives?](so-whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives). New approaches and expertise must be developed to meet these challenges and opportunities.\n\nThese aren't problems to be solved, so much as issues to be managed, and some guiding principles. **Recognizable patterns** emerge, which can be seen in the sector as a whole, and by individual organizations and teams, that suggest ways in which we can think usefully about how to better builders, better funders and supporter, and better participants in these initiatives.\n\nReferences and Resources: \n* Lucy Bernholz, \"[Civil Society as the Immune System for Democracy](https://philanthropy.blogspot.com/2018/01/civil-society-as-immune-system-for.html)\" (2018).",
