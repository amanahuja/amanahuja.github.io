Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, a strategic product roadmap with a three-year horizon was drafted for G.</description></item><item><title>COVID Modeling Accelerator</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</guid><description>Overview Fenris partnered with the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) and Rockefeller Foundation to help a cohort of academic research teams better meet the needs of state and local decision-makers for actionable insights from epidemiological, economic and operational data models.
The COVID Modeling Accelerator was created to support a cohort of academic research teams to meet the needs of state and local decision-makers for actionable insights to better respond to the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description></item><item><title>eGUIDE Products for Energy Planning</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/eguide-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/eguide-api/</guid><description>Aman worked with the Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies (e-GUIDE) Initiative to help set objectives, design an approach and implement a first version of their public-facing API.
The Fenris engagement helped center the team’s collaborations and Initiative partnerships. Following best practices for user-centered API design, we helped the team challenge their own assumptions about the value and utility of the consumption prediction models. Aman also provided technical mentorship and collaboration with the engineering lead.</description></item><item><title>Future of Property Rights</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/future-property-rights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/future-property-rights/</guid><description>I helped a New America, a US public policy think tank, to define objectives and roadmaps for a multi-stakeholder initiative that advances public discourse surrounding property rights insecurity and loss in the United States.

Fenris collaborated with Project ECHO team on a needs assessment, data strategy discussions and metrics design. The initiative centered on two outcomes:
A set of high-level recommendations for the ECHO data and technology team The team worked together to plan, design and create a infographic “one-pager” that will be a new asset for ECHO moving forward.</description></item><item><title>Data Platform for Clinical Trials</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</guid><description>The Guild worked with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world to develop a new approach to data sharing in clinical research. The immediate objective was to decrease the time and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. We developed design principles that centered openness, transparency, and improved outcomes for patients.
The approach centered an open technical platform with independent governance to guarantee the compliance, quality, and interoperability of software offerings in clinical trials.</description></item><item><title>Data sharing for the Office of Recidivism and Justice</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/recidivism-data-sharing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/recidivism-data-sharing/</guid><description>Fenris helped design data governance and infrastructure to improve data collection, analysis and information sharing between a California county&amp;rsquo;s justice agencies. We focused on goal-setting and increased cooperation in a low-trust environment, working towards improved reentry services and reduced recidivism.
We partnered with the Office of Recidivism and Justice (ORJ) under the County Administrator, and through interviews and conversations worked with multiple stakeholders including the Sherriff&amp;rsquo;s office, the Probation Department, the county Court, and community based organizations (CBOs).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Platform</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</guid><description>A working peer-to-peer residential energy trading marketplace helped us understand user pains, preconceptions and motivations for trading excess energy with others.
I led a team at The Data Guild in partnership with AGL, a major Australian power company, to develop and pilot a peer-to-peer residential energy trading platform in which users with rooftop solar and battery storage could trade excess energy with others in an automated marketplace.
In the first phase of this project we worked with our Australia-based client to understand the potential impact of peer to peer markets in the relevant space, and to design an MVP that would demonstrate technical and business feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Proteus Digital Health</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/proteus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/proteus/</guid><description>The Data Guild advised on strategic approach to develop new market opportunities for a medical device company in the wearable space. One concept explored recovery cycle applications for professional athletes. Device interfaced with mobile device through an application with FDA regulatory considerations.
Our team also developed and tested the &amp;ldquo;recovery&amp;rdquo; calculation for the pilot, utilizing biometric data such as heart rate to calculate sleep and orthostatic stress conditions for individuals wearing the device.</description></item><item><title>EnergySavvy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/energysavvy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/energysavvy/</guid><description>The Data Guild helped develop and assess models and key performance indicators (KPIs) for energy usage. Designed methods to measure change after some event (causal inference) using counter-factuals, and corresponding uncertainty. Provided strategic direction and best practices related to code, machine learning systems, and parallelizing analysis.
Benchmarked against the ASHRAE 14 definition of savings New definition of energy savings based on counterfactuals &amp;amp; building models Machine learning (ML) pipeline parallelization Technologies utilized: python and scikit tools, starcluster spot instances on AWS compute.</description></item><item><title>C3 Energy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</guid><description>The Data Guild consulted on the development of a malfunction and theft detection system for energy utility providers. The client&amp;rsquo;s analytics engine enabled petabyte=scale grid data aggregation of historical and operational data, including smart-meter data, billing and service history, and various metadata.
Our approach built on work by a team from Berkeley, innovating using a bagging and unsupervised support vector machine (SVM). Technologies utilized included python-based libraries (pandas, sklearn, etc) on AWS-based parallel computation.</description></item></channel></rss>
