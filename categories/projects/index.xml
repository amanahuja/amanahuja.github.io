Designed methods to measure change after some event (causal inference) using counter-factuals, and corresponding uncertainty. Provided strategic direction and best practices related to code, machine learning systems, and parallelizing analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Benchmarked against the ASHRAE 14 definition of savings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New definition of energy savings based on counterfactuals &amp;amp; building models&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Machine learning (ML) pipeline parallelization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technologies utilized: python and scikit tools, starcluster spot instances on AWS compute.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aman designed the ML pipeline and parallelization, implementing the savings calculation at scale. I worked with the team to assess our new savings calculation against the benchmark standard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>C3 Energy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Data Guild consulted on the development of a malfunction and theft detection system for energy utility providers. The client&amp;rsquo;s analytics engine enabled petabyte=scale grid data aggregation of historical and operational data, including smart-meter data, billing and service history, and various metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our approach built on work by a team from Berkeley, innovating using a bagging and unsupervised support vector machine (SVM).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technologies utilized included python-based libraries (pandas, sklearn, etc) on AWS-based parallel computation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aman&amp;rsquo;s role was as a senior machine learning consultant. I helped design and implement the approach, identifying and ranking potential theft sites.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
