I created the cells, which were composed of a small sample of the LC on a glass slide in a specific physical configuration, and under a microscope I inspected the LC&rsquo;s phase transitions under applied temperature and electrical fields. I&rsquo;ll add a little more information about the science in the blog post linked above.</p><p>The relationship between the CU-Boulder physics lab, and the start up DisplayTech was intimate. Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference between the two. Both groups were interested in publishing novel research, both were interested in financially lucrative applications of the science, and often it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me even to which group an individual or an effort belonged. At the beginning of the summer I spent more time on campus, but by the end I was at the startup most days of the week.</p><h2 id=quick-reference>Quick Reference</h2><h3 id=about-flc-device-technology>About FLC device technology</h3><p>See papers by Noel Clark and others.

The company specialized in ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon (FLCOS) microdisplays. At the time (early 2000s) their technology was impressive in achieving high resolution and very fast switching, and had applications in viewfinders for handheld digital cameras and in rear-projection displays.
