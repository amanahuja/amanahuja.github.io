with governments and major stakeholders around the world to create a digital
space that supports collaboration among the global epidemic intelligence community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project&amp;rsquo;s stated objective was to create&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A digital environment where subject experts and the epidemic and pandemic
intelligence community converge to communicate, cultivate ideas and
co-develop, to rapidly generate and provide community-driven solutions to
address existing challenges and needs in the domain of data, analytics, and
evidence-based decision-making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>International Initiative on Pandemic Prevention</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-the-initiative">About the Initiative&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A major initiative with millions of dollars in funding was launched to develop computational tools for public health decisions related to disease pathogens affected by climate change. The host institute developed partnerships around the world, focusing on areas where conditions such as rising temperatures, flooding, and changing habitats are critical factors to disease prevention and response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developing effective tools required collaboration between multiple stakeholders contributing data, hospitals and other providers, academics and epidemiological experts, and as a collaborator-client, local government agencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Leadership Cohort</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/data-leadership-cohort/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/data-leadership-cohort/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2022, Fenris, along with Aspiration and Digital Public, launched a new
program on data leadership and governance. The Data Leadership Cohort was
designed to create opportunities for leaders to learn from peers about
governance, stewardship and long-term responsible leadership in data-centric
missions and ventures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Data Leadership Cohort brought together Aspiration’s field-leading and
tested frameworks for peer learning, Digital Public’s expertise in public
interest data governance, and practical expertise from Fenris for integrating
these ideas into team, process and product.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Global.health</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fenris worked with the Global.health leadership team to help align product development with long-term strategic objectives and to deliver value for the sector.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, a &lt;em>strategic product roadmap&lt;/em> with a three-year horizon was drafted for G.h, and aligned with funding opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID Modeling Accelerator</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="db mh0 w-100">&lt;img src="https://amanahuja.me/images/cma_splash.png"
