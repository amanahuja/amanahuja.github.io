&lt;p>Presenters: Denise Gershbein + Aman Ahuja&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this presentation at Design Week 2018 in Denver Colorado, Denise and Aman spoke about intersections between design and data paradigms, and on a model for the product studio focused on impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract from the Design Week program&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Denise and Aman have a combined 30+ years of working in design, data science and social change. Their work often targets impact through seeking levers in the system &amp;ndash; working at several levels at once to influence, build capacity, and release solutions that affect the system in multiple places, with a cascading effect.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
