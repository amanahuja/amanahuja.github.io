The talk aimed to provide undergraduate students an alternate perspective into their curriculum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The narrative wove together several threads of discussion:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The history of data science and statistical tools, such as factor analysis, and how they might inform our current practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rather than viewing outliers and anomalies as mere inconveniences, Aman encouraged students to see them as opportunities for insight and exploration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drawing from years of consulting experience, Aman shared relevant stories where constraints led to unexpected outcomes or inventive solutions, offering students a glimpse into the dynamic nature of data science in practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The lecture was supported by Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the Data, Society and Inference Seminar series. The presentation was given at 190 Doe Library on UC Berkeley campus, the newly established BIDS center.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
