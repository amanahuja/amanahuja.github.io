We partnered with the Office of Recidivism and Justice (ORJ) under the County Administrator, and through interviews and conversations worked with multiple stakeholders including the Sherriff&amp;rsquo;s office, the Probation Department, the county Court, and community based organizations (CBOs). A presentation of our methodology, deliverables, and recommendations for re-entry data management was provided in-person to the Community Corrections Partnership Executive Committee at a public forum committee meeting.</description></item><item><title>DataKind SF Bay Area Chapter</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/datakind-sf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/datakind-sf/</guid><description>I founded the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of DataKind in 2013, and served as one of the chapter leaders for several years.

Designed methods to measure change after some event (causal inference) using counter-factuals, and corresponding uncertainty. Provided strategic direction and best practices related to code, machine learning systems, and parallelizing analysis.
Benchmarked against the ASHRAE 14 definition of savings New definition of energy savings based on counterfactuals &amp;amp; building models Machine learning (ML) pipeline parallelization Technologies utilized: python and scikit tools, starcluster spot instances on AWS compute.</description></item></channel></rss>
