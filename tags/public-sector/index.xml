I helped develop sustainable networks and processes for the chapter, and executed strategies for managing and training volunteers, building and supporting networks of organization-partners, and various operations.
I continue to advise and consult with DataKind Global and the Bay Area chapter.
DataKind brings together data scientists with leading social change organizations for pro-bono collaborations to improve social impact.</description></item></channel></rss>
