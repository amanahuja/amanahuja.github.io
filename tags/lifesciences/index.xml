&lt;p>Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, a &lt;em>strategic product roadmap&lt;/em> with a three-year horizon was drafted for G.h, and aligned with funding opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Platform for Clinical Trials</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Guild worked with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world to develop a new approach to data sharing in clinical research. The immediate objective was to decrease the time and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. We developed design principles that centered openness, transparency, and improved outcomes for patients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach centered an open technical platform with independent governance to guarantee the compliance, quality, and interoperability of software offerings in clinical trials. By working at the center of clinical data systems and their partners, the Guild identified a range of new data- and AI-enabled clinical research capabilities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
