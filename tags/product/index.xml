WRI is an organization we&amp;rsquo;ve long admired, as home to several of the world&amp;rsquo;s most important data products in the service of climate action and human well-being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are proud and very excited to be partnering with the Data Lab at WRI, which operates to support teams across the organization and. The Data Lab also runs an product studio, helping WRI teams develop new infrastructure, improve features, and incubate new data products. Our collaboration focuses on strengthening their product and AI innovation capacity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A digital space for global collaboration on Epidemic and Pandemic Intelligence</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalpandemichub/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalpandemichub/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our client was a well-resourced and internationally recognized team working
with governments and major stakeholders around the world to create a digital
space that supports collaboration among the global epidemic intelligence community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project&amp;rsquo;s stated objective was to create&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A digital environment where subject experts and the epidemic and pandemic
intelligence community converge to communicate, cultivate ideas and
co-develop, to rapidly generate and provide community-driven solutions to
address existing challenges and needs in the domain of data, analytics, and
evidence-based decision-making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>International Initiative on Pandemic Prevention</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-the-initiative">About the Initiative&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A major initiative with millions of dollars in funding was launched to develop computational tools for public health decisions related to disease pathogens affected by climate change. The host institute developed partnerships around the world, focusing on areas where conditions such as rising temperatures, flooding, and changing habitats are critical factors to disease prevention and response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developing effective tools required collaboration between multiple stakeholders contributing data, hospitals and other providers, academics and epidemiological experts, and as a collaborator-client, local government agencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Global.health</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fenris worked with the Global.health leadership team to help align product development with long-term strategic objectives and to deliver value for the sector.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, a &lt;em>strategic product roadmap&lt;/em> with a three-year horizon was drafted for G.h, and aligned with funding opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>eGUIDE Products for Energy Planning</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/eguide-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/eguide-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>Aman worked with the Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies (e-GUIDE) Initiative to help set objectives, design an approach and implement a first version of their public-facing API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fenris engagement helped center the team’s collaborations and Initiative partnerships. Following best practices for user-centered API design, we helped the team challenge their own assumptions about the value and utility of the consumption prediction models. Aman also provided technical mentorship and collaboration with the engineering lead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project ECHO</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/project-echo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/project-echo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fenris worked with Project ECHO to provide mentorship on product strategy, build metrics, and develop reusable assets for dashboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fenris collaborated with Project ECHO team on a needs assessment, data strategy discussions and metrics design. The initiative centered on two outcomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A set of high-level recommendations for the ECHO data and technology team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The team worked together to plan, design and create a infographic “one-pager” that will be a new asset for ECHO moving forward.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Presenters: Denise Gershbein + Aman Ahuja&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this presentation at Design Week 2018 in Denver Colorado, Denise and Aman spoke about intersections between design and data paradigms, and on a model for the product studio focused on impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract from the Design Week program&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Denise and Aman have a combined 30+ years of working in design, data science and social change. Their work often targets impact through seeking levers in the system &amp;ndash; working at several levels at once to influence, build capacity, and release solutions that affect the system in multiple places, with a cascading effect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Platform</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</guid><description>&lt;p>A working peer-to-peer residential energy trading marketplace helped us understand user pains, preconceptions and motivations for trading excess energy with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I led a team at The Data Guild in partnership with AGL, a major Australian power company, to develop and pilot a peer-to-peer residential energy trading platform in which users with rooftop solar and battery storage could trade excess energy with others in an automated marketplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first phase of this project we worked with our Australia-based client to understand the potential impact of peer to peer markets in the relevant space, and to design an MVP that would demonstrate technical and business feasibility. In the second phase, we assembled a technical, design, and user research team to build a working MVP, deploy with a pilot population, and understand user reactions and motivations for the marketplace.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
