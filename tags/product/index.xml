WRI has always been an organization we&amp;rsquo;ve admired, as the home of some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most important data products that are in the service of climate action and human well-being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re proud and very excited to be partnering with WRI&amp;rsquo;s Data Lab, which operates to support teams across the organozation and and runs an internal product studio, helping WRI teams develop new infrastructure, improved features, and completely new data products.

&lt;p>Presenters: Denise Gershbein + Aman Ahuja&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this presentation at Design Week 2018 in Denver Colorado, Denise and Aman spoke about intersections between design and data paradigms, and on a model for the product studio focused on impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract from the Design Week program&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Denise and Aman have a combined 30+ years of working in design, data science and social change. Their work often targets impact through seeking levers in the system &amp;ndash; working at several levels at once to influence, build capacity, and release solutions that affect the system in multiple places, with a cascading effect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Platform</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</guid><description>&lt;p>A working peer-to-peer residential energy trading marketplace helped us understand user pains, preconceptions and motivations for trading excess energy with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I led a team at The Data Guild in partnership with AGL, a major Australian power company, to develop and pilot a peer-to-peer residential energy trading platform in which users with rooftop solar and battery storage could trade excess energy with others in an automated marketplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first phase of this project we worked with our Australia-based client to understand the potential impact of peer to peer markets in the relevant space, and to design an MVP that would demonstrate technical and business feasibility. In the second phase, we assembled a technical, design, and user research team to build a working MVP, deploy with a pilot population, and understand user reactions and motivations for the marketplace.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
