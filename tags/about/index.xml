First and foremost, my family... Anya Veena and Nand Asheesh, Payal, Anushri Donna, Herb, Zosha, Kevin My grand-parents and great-grand-parents Lucy Bernholz My own ideas on public goods and civil society are mere derivatives of Lucy's work. She led the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford, the impact of which will far exceed its own lifespan.</description></item></channel></rss>
