systems. Working closely with their leadership team, we focused on responsible data stewardship while developing new service offerings and platform concepts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our engagement centered on two key initiatives: designing and analyzing a comprehensive survey of food-insecure individuals in New York City, and facilitating strategic alignment
workshops to guide Plentiful&amp;rsquo;s data platform development and revenue diversification.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
