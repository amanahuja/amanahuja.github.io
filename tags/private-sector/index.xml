One concept explored recovery cycle applications for professional athletes. Device interfaced with mobile device through an application with FDA regulatory considerations.
Our team also developed and tested the &amp;ldquo;recovery&amp;rdquo; calculation for the pilot, utilizing biometric data such as heart rate to calculate sleep and orthostatic stress conditions for individuals wearing the device.</description></item><item><title>C3 Energy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</guid><description>The Data Guild consulted on the development of a malfunction and theft detection system for energy utility providers. The client&amp;rsquo;s analytics engine enabled petabyte=scale grid data aggregation of historical and operational data, including smart-meter data, billing and service history, and various metadata.
Our approach built on work by a team from Berkeley, innovating using a bagging and unsupervised support vector machine (SVM). Technologies utilized included python-based libraries (pandas, sklearn, etc) on AWS-based parallel computation.</description></item></channel></rss>
