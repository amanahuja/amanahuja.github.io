We provided strategic guidance during a pivotal phase of this multi-year initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://oceancensus.org">Ocean Census&lt;/a>, launched by The Nippon Foundation and Nekton, is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest collaborative effort to accelerate the discovery of marine life, endorsed under the United Nations Ocean Decade. The initiative brings together governments, philanthropic supporters, and leading marine research organizations to discover and document an estimated 1-2 million undiscovered marine species before they potentially go extinct.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CEA Pod</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/tdg-cea-pod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/tdg-cea-pod/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Data Guild ran a research &amp;ldquo;pod&amp;rdquo; to explore recent advancements in controlled environment agriculture. CEA has the potential to address areas of concern to the Guild: energy efficiency, human health, economic development, water and resource conservation, and climate resilience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pod followed a structured methodology to understand the landscape of important players in this space, generate a simplified systems map, and to identify intersections with the Guild&amp;rsquo;s strengths and related efforts. The pod members conducted interviews with experts and visited several CEA facilities. Among the outputs was several proposals for data products, each with a preliminary business canvas.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
