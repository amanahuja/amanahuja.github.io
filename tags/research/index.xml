CEA has the potential to address areas of concern to the Guild: energy efficiency, human health, economic development, water and resource conservation, and climate resilience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pod followed a structured methodology to understand the landscape of important players in this space, generate a simplified systems map, and to identify intersections with the Guild&amp;rsquo;s strengths and related efforts. The pod members conducted interviews with experts and visited several CEA facilities. Among the outputs was several proposals for data products, each with a preliminary business canvas.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
