Through my network, Fenris, I bring together colleagues and experts to help my clients succeed. My teamâ€™s work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data &amp;amp; AI ethics, and managing power imbalances.
In addition to data science and software development expertise, we help clients build their product strategy, technical roadmaps, and improve user adoption. We understand the importance of carefully constructed feedback loops and the delicate risk/benefit balance of outcome metrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
