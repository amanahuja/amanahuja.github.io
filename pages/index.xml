My focus is on civil society (non profit, academic) teams seeking to improve reach, adoption, and financial independence. Through my network, Fenris, I bring together colleagues and experts to help my clients succeed. My team’s work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data &amp;amp; AI ethics, and managing power imbalances.
In addition to data science and software development expertise, we help clients build their product strategy, technical roadmaps, and improve user adoption.</description></item><item><title>Hi.
