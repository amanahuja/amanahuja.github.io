Designed methods to measure change after some event (causal inference) using counter-factuals, and corresponding uncertainty. Provided strategic direction and best practices related to code, machine learning systems, and parallelizing analysis.
Benchmarked against the ASHRAE 14 definition of savings New definition of energy savings based on counterfactuals &amp;amp; building models Machine learning (ML) pipeline parallelization Technologies utilized: python and scikit tools, starcluster spot instances on AWS compute.</description></item><item><title>Example Template for Portfolio entry</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/change-this-slug/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 1999 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/change-this-slug/</guid><description>TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted; nor is it ever accidental.
