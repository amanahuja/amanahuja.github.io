My focus is on civil society (non profit, academic) teams seeking to improve reach, adoption, and financial independence. Through my network, Fenris, I bring together colleagues and experts to help my clients succeed. My teamâ€™s work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data &amp;amp; AI ethics, and managing power imbalances.
In addition to data science and software development expertise, we help clients build their product strategy, technical roadmaps, and improve user adoption.</description></item><item><title>COVID Modeling Accelerator</title><link>http://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://amanahuja.me/portfolio/covid-modeling-accelerator/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="2020---2021">2020 - 2021&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A partnership of Rockefeller Foundation (RF), the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) and Fenris, the &lt;em>COVID Modeling Accelerator&lt;/em> offered modular packages of funding ($50k - $200k each) and technical assistance (including user research, product strategy, and UI design). This support was offered to academic modeling teams to create tools, dashboards, and insights for state and local decision makers and public health officials responding to COVID-19.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
