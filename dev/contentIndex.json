This discussion highlights just a few of those issues and focuses specifically on challenges to the responsible and effective use of data in the sector.*\n\nIn the social sector, there is a higher bar for success than there is in other sectors. There is a greater need for fairness, accountability and transparency when working with vulnerable populations, in social services, and in domains such as criminal justice. The cost of failure is higher, and incrementalism can be more damaging than beneficial. \n\n{{% inset %}}\nWhen I was chapter leader at DataKindSF, we would often get inquiries from local universities and schools; they were looking for \"social good\" projects through which students could practice basic skills. They hoped to use engagements with local nonprofits and charities as a way of showing real world experience on resumes, typically when applying for jobs at \"real\" companies. \n\nWhile I sought ways to support good intentions and opportunities for exposure, I also saw this as frustratingly backwards. For profit jobs, in most cases, are simpler, more compartmentalized, and come with structure, training and mentoring opportunities. They utilize data that are more trustworthy and more complete, and apply them in problem spaces that have simple causal chains that are easy to understand.\n\nPerhaps, instead, we should see an internship at a for-profit corporation as a way to learn basic skills in preparation for a job at a non profit? \n{{% /inset %}}\n\nChallenges and issues that may cause a data initiative to fail: \n* **Funding runs out**, and the team is unable to secure new funding. \n* **Team members leave the project**. This type of instability can be caused by lack of career options for the team, poor or insufficient leadership, or simply because students graduate. Bus factor risk can exacerbate the impact of team turnover.\n* **Leaders lose interest**. Inventive structures and motivation are skewed towards innovation and building, especially for leaders in academic institutions. Many leaders aren't interested or well-suited to managing teams, sustaining operations. \n* **Takeover**: The organization or project is absorbed, usually by a funder or sponsor. This can be subtle, as when board seats are captured to redirect resources. \n* The **absence or instability of legal structure** can be the downfall of initiatives. For example, when the initiative has no clear owner, or when there are problems in attaining desired legal status and fiscal sponsorship.\n\nI'm intentionally and dangerously grouping under the term \"civil society\" a plurality of organizations and initiatives that are completely different from each other, and that face very different challenges. \n\n**For example...**\n\nData tools in academic contexts and universities: \n* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitrm\n* see notes on DPCS, CMA, routes. \n\nData system used by journalists, activists and for civil discource: \n* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitrm\n* threat models\n* monetization\n\nData products created by non profits and NGOs: \n* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitrm\n* \n\n**Meeting the challenge**\n\nIn [building sector capacity](building_capacity.md) in the sector, these are the types of challenges we can and must address.",

This falls far short of true sector-level capacity building, which involves strengthening and building institutions, capabilities and experts in a network that is interdependent, resilient, and self supporting. \n\nInstead, we should imagine all the roles and organizations that do not yet exist, that will live within the sector or directly strengthen it. \n\nOne way to look at this ecosystem in civil society as of consisting of: \n* Independent entities of civil society. This list varies depending on who you ask, but often includes nonprofits, NGOs, academic institutions, hospitals, journalistic & media organizations, and religious organizations. \n* Data initiatives, and projects. These may be housed within one organization, or may be collaborations between many organizations from within and without civil society. \n* Funders, including governments, philanthopy, and private donors. \n* Experts and consultants. These include lawyers and accountants and their firms, that focus on relevant issues. \n* Vendors of products and services in addition to the above experts. Examples are: strategy consulting firms, software and technology vendors, etc. \n\nA few comments are important here. \n\nFirst, this ecosystem contains entities from all sectors. Many nodes in this network are in the private sector (e.g. a for-profit software vendor) or in the public sector (e.g. NSF in the US as a funder). They are included in this ecosystem because of their interaction and importance in civil society data initiatives, but they themselves could be from any sector.\n\nI also want to note that this description is not intended as a taxonomy. It's not exhaustive, there is some overlap and unclear boundaries between these groups. Instead the intention is to draw attention to a few specific areas of my interest. Finally, I am focused on data initiatives in civil society, and this description of the ecosystem reflects that lens. \n\nThere are additional categories of organizations in this network that are of particular interest.\n\n*Special interest communities* <br />\nThese are communities and networks in civil society that support each other, usually directed towards common interest or issues. Some are trade associations, like the Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network (NTEN). \n\n*Support organizations* <br />\nThese are organizations or groups that serve other civil society orgs and efforts. These may be \"vertically oriented\" around domains, such as the Centre for Investigative Journalism. Or, they might provide resources \"horizontally\". An important example of the latter horizontal type are the technology transfer offices at universities, that help academic research and efforts develop into organizations, IP, patents, or products. There's much to say about the role of tech transfer offices in supporting the [Six Pillars](pillars-of-capacity.md). \n\n### Building a healthy ecosystem\n\nIt is useful, then, to ask what makes this ecosystem healthy and resilient. Are there members of this ecosystem that are bad actors in some way, on which others are dependent? \n\nThese are some of the nodes, links and paths in this network that deserve attention: \n* [Scaffolding Orgs](scaffolding-orgs.md)\n\n\nnote\n* discuss national and local policy infrastructure (and in some cases international policy as well).

Often the focus is only on innovation, and the first public release. There's an assumption that users and stakeholders will see value in the tool and choose to perform occasional updates, and that's sufficient. \n\nThis lack of attention to full life cycle is emblematic of broader issues:\n* Funding and programs favor MVPs and pilots over meaningul and sustained impact\n* Lack of knowledge retention, few reusable assets, and work repeated on the same challenges. \n* Strategic and long-term thinking is de-prioritized, or is disjoint between the organization(s) and the technology and data initiative. \n\nInspiration: \n* Fabriders [life cycle of network-centric resources](https://www.fabriders.net/network-centric-resources-lifecycle/)",

That's why we might care if a newspaper is owned by a nation-state, or if an alleged public good is provided by a for profit corporation.\n\nOn the other hand, many important initiatives involve relationships that span these boundaries. We might talk about \"public-private partnerships\" and similar. Government and corporations increasingly fund these  organizations, and we increasingly look to philanthropy rooted in the private sector for creating and supporting public goods. New types of organizations sit intentionally between the sectors. **The boundaries between these sectors can be fuzzy**, and is getting fuzzier.\n\nMy energy is focused on civil society (and on collaborations where a civil society org plays a central role) because *civil society is really important*.\n* The civil sector carries many of our democratic values, and ideas that make society safer, fairer and more just. \n* Civil society resists centralized control and expoloitative profiteering, and supports efforts that do the same. \n* An eroding civil society is a sign of an unhealthy country -- and indicates a lack of desire or ability to participate, reduced check-and-balances on power, and greater apathy for marginalized communities. \n\nMost organizations in civil society inreasingly operate in digital spaces and would be more effective through the use of data and technology -- as discussed by Lucy Bernholz and the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford. \n\nThis creates many problems, and also many great [opportunities](opportunities.md), ways in which organizations will be more successful, more able to support their communities, through the  use of data. And this has hope of strengthening our society as whole.\n\nI have worked with many such organizations that are struggling to use data effectively, and responsibly. I've seen civil society initiatives attempt to build data-centric tools that are centered in civil society values, and not merely transplants, or short-lived donations, from tech-savvy private sector companies. We've sought ways of making our work resilient, financially sustainable, and appropriately governed. \n\nImportant factors make data initiatives in civil society very different from government projects or for-profit products --> [So what's different about civil society data initiatives?](whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives). New approaches and expertise must be developed to meet these challenges and opportunities.\n\nThese aren't problems to be solved, so much as issues to be managed, and some guiding principles. **Recognizable patterns** emerge, which can be seen in the sector as a whole, and by individual organizations and teams, that suggest ways in which we can think usefully about how to better builders, better funders and supporter, and better participants in these initiatives.\n\nReferences and Recommended Reading: \n* Lucy Bernholz, [\"Civil Society as the Immune System for Democracy\"](https://philanthropy.blogspot.com/2018/01/civil-society-as-immune-system-for.html) (2018).",
