    "content": "{{% inset %}}\nCivil society data initiatives: \n* Are often multi-team collaborative efforts with a complexity of incentives\n  and power-dynamics\n* These are each different groups: the \"user\", the \"data subject\", the \"stakeholder\". \n* The purpose or role of data in the project may be fundamentally different\n* Data sources must be treated as imperfect representations of reality\n* Have different funding and sustainability models than we see in the private and public sectors.\n{{% /inset %}}\n\nHaving acknowledged that we should think carefully about [the use of data in civil society](why-is-civil-society-important.md), we  might ask, well, is this just a matter of directing our collective focus? Can we simply do what we have been doing elsewhere, now with civil society organizations? Can we not utilize, with a few adjustments, those tools, skills, and methods that we created for such initiatives in other problem-spaces?\n\nI'm talking about the technical infrastructures, the agile methodologies and the coding practices. The product mindset, the user-centered design, the way we structure our teams. The funding ideas will be different, that's clear, and some legal frameworks, but that _feels_ not so relevant to the data problems themselves. \n\nIn fact, there are really important differences between a civil society data initiatives and those at a for-profit organization, or one run by the government. And these differences require that we evaluate carefully any direct application of familiar tools or methods, and that, in fact, we may need to build new approaches entirely. \n\nAnd this understanding -- that civil society is different, that the problems it tries to solve are different, that the values and principles we need to carry in its work are different, and that together we have to really identify these differences and plan for them -- this undertanding allows us to see the whole sector with new perspective, one that is not just wary of pitfalls but is also full of fresh ideas and opportunities. \n\n{{<pullquote >}}\nThis understanding allows us to see the whole sector with new perspective, one that is not just wary of pitfalls, but also full of fresh ideas and opportunities and a renewed promise. \n{{< /pullquote >}}\n\n##### Multiple teams collaborating\n\nCivil society data initiatives are often multi-team collaborative efforts with a complexity of incentives and power-dynamics. \n\nOne [US county that we worked with](/portfolio/recidivism-data-sharing/) was aware that understanding recidivism requires bringing together information from many organizations. An individual's interactions with the justice system over time may include the Sheriff's office, the courts, prison, the probation office, community based organizations (CBOs) and more. Whether or not they recidivate, they may encounter many of these multiple times. \n\nThese are all organizations that are part of the same system, the justice system, and they frequently interact with one another. They even have common goals -- such as to reduce recidivism. So in a broad sense, there is a shared incentive to bring their data together So in a broad sense, there is a shared incentive to bring their data together. \n\nAnd yet, there are good reasons why they may hesitate from cooperating. These organizations often have conflicting incentives as well. A public defender can be described as both coordinating with and at odds with the district attorney. A community based organization may have information about a program participant that they would not want to share with their probation officer. \n\nThe county justice system _as a whole_ may benefit from better understanding how individuals traverse the justice system, how to improve interventions, to see how recidivism rates have changed over time and what programs lead to improved outcomes. Pooling their siloed data may help make better decisions about these programs, and might help identify problems in the system that could be addressed. \n\nBut who would get all that data? How will it be used, and who will decide how to use it? How can we ensure that such a system would be used for the benefit of the community, and not against it? \n\n##### The user, the data subject and the stakeholders\n\nPlaceholder.\n\"User-centered design\" remains for many people a mantra against all design problems. But when, say, a nonprofit organization builds a tool, it may find that it's _not clear who the user even is._\n\n##### Rethinking the role of data\n\nPlaceholder.\n\n##### Data, truth and reality\nPlaceholder.\n\n##### Funding, sustainability, and the project lifecycle\nPlaceholder.",

    "title": "Why Civil Society matters",
    "content": "The term *civil society* refers to the \"third leg\" of society, along with the private sector, and the public sector. \n\nCivil society is considered inclusive of academia, journalists, religious groups, NGOs, and importantly, activists and nonprofits. \n\n> Note: The term \"civic sector\" is used to refer to things related to the government, which can be confusing; here we are referring to *civil* and not *civic*. \n\nOne one hand, independence between these sectors can be critical, and provides an important **counterbalance** in society. That's why we might care if a newspaper is owned by a nation-state, or if an alleged public good is provided by a for profit corporation.\n\nOn the other hand, many important initiatives involve **partnerships between the three sectors**, and thus we often talk about \"public-private partnerships\" and similar.  New types of organizations sit intentionally between the sectors, with unclear outcomes. We increasingly look to philanthropy rooted in the private sector for public goods. The boundaries between sectors case can be fuzzy, and is getting fuzzier, both for better and for worse.\n\nMy energy is focused on civil society (and on collaborations where a civil society org plays a central role) because *civil society is really important*.\n* The civil sector carries many of our democratic values, and ideas that make society safer, fairer and more just. \n* Civil society resists centralized control and expoloitative profiteering, and supports efforts that do the same. \n* An eroding civil society is a sign of an unhealthy country -- and indicates a lack of desire or ability to participate, reduced check-and-balances on power, and greater apathy for marginalized communities. \n\nMost organizations in civil society inreasingly operate in digital spaces and would be more effective through the use of data and technology -- as discussed by Lucy Bernholz and the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford. \n\nI have worked with many such organizations that are struggling to use data effectively, and responsibly. I've seen civil society initiatives attempt to build data-centric tools that are centered in civil society values, and not merely transplants, or short-lived donations, from tech-savvy private sector companies. We've sought ways of making our work resilient, financially sustainable, and appropriately governed. \n\nImportant factors make data initiatives in civil society very different from government projects or for-profit products --> [So what's different about civil society data initiatives?](whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives). New approaches and expertise must be developed to meet these challenges and opportunities.\n\nThese aren't problems to be solved, so much as issues to be managed, and some guiding principles. **Recognizable patterns** emerge, which can be seen in the sector as a whole, and by individual organizations and teams, that suggest ways in which we can think usefully about how to better builders, better funders and supporter, and better participants in these initiatives.\n\nReferences and Resources: \n* Lucy Bernholz, \"[Civil Society as the Immune System for Democracy](https://philanthropy.blogspot.com/2018/01/civil-society-as-immune-system-for.html)\" (2018).",
