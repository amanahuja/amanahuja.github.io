The project&amp;rsquo;s stated objective was to create
&amp;ldquo;A digital environment where subject experts and the epidemic and pandemic intelligence community converge to communicate, cultivate ideas and co-develop, to rapidly generate and provide community-driven solutions to address existing challenges and needs in the domain of data, analytics, and evidence-based decision-making.</description></item><item><title>International Initiative on Pandemic Prevention</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/dengue-public-health/</guid><description>About the Initiative A major initiative with millions of dollars in funding was launched to develop computational tools for public health decisions related to disease pathogens affected by climate change. The host institute developed partnerships around the world, focusing on areas where conditions such as rising temperatures, flooding, and changing habitats are critical factors to disease prevention and response.
Developing effective tools required collaboration between multiple stakeholders contributing data, hospitals and other providers, academics and epidemiological experts, and as a collaborator-client, local government agencies.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/privacy-policy/</guid><description>This is Aman Ahuja&amp;rsquo;s personal website.

New types of leaders are emerging to meet these challenges, but few resources are available to inform governance, stewardship and long-term responsible leadership in data-centric missions and ventures.
Building and supporting these leaders is one of the core capacities needed in civil society.</description></item><item><title>Digital Infrastructure</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/digital-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/digital-infrastructure/</guid><description>The challenges and threat models in civil society impose specific requirements on its technical and digital infrastructure.
There must be equitable access for all; technological and legal structures that ensure safe participation; systems, applications, and regulations that protect human dignity; and oversight and governance mechanisms that embody the principles of democratic societies.
&amp;ndash; PACS Digital Civil Society Lab
There is a growing conversation about these priorities, such as a cloud infrastucture that cannot be compromised or shut down by a corporation or government.</description></item><item><title>Ecosystem and Network</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/ecosystem-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/ecosystem-network/</guid><description>Building capacity is too often framed as training for individuals or for teams. This falls far short of true sector-level capacity building, which involves strengthening and building institutions, capabilities and experts in a network that is interdependent, resilient, and self supporting.
Instead, we should imagine all the roles and organizations that do not yet exist, that will live within the sector or directly strengthen it.
One way to look at this ecosystem in civil society as of consisting of:</description></item><item><title>Governance Frameworks</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/governance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/governance/</guid><description>To address governance issues for a specific data initiative we need to understand:
The policy landscape as it relates to the initiative. The regulatory environment The ethical issues and approaches to address them Power imbalances, especially in stakeholder and funder relationships We see governance as a process, rather than a set of rules or agreements. It must continually evolve, and be able to address new and unanticipated questions. It must be sustainable over relevant periods of time, which means that it must remain relevant and empowered.</description></item><item><title>Sustainable Models</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/sustainable-models/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/sustainable-models/</guid><description>Sustainability means, of course, financial sustainability, but also many other factors that determine the ability of an data initiative to remain successful and continue to provide value or deliver impact, for the intended duration.
Consider some of the patterns I have encountered that are problematic in this regard.
Many data initiatives are intentionally designed to be short lived, relying on an initial infusion of resources for a pre-determined duration, usually 3 years or less.</description></item><item><title>Healthy Life cycles</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/healthy-life-cycles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/healthy-life-cycles/</guid><description>We imagine each resource, each technology and data initiative, as progressing through phases. A biological metaphor might speak about conception and adolesence, to adult maturation, and then death and even beyond death.
Actual initiatives are not linear, but messy and complex and iterative. So, let&amp;rsquo;s extend our mental image from one initiative to many, to hundreds. At any given moment there are many initiatives &amp;ndash; and potential initiatives and past initiatives &amp;ndash; at the same time, at each phase of this life cycle.</description></item><item><title>Pillars of Capacity</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/pillars-of-capacity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/pillars-of-capacity/</guid><description>The sector has long recognized ways in which it is different from the private and government sector. It has its own perspective on how efforts should be selected and grown and sustained. It has its own measures of success, and its sets of principles and best practices. The use of data, specifically, presents unique opportunities and challenges to civil society.
We need strutural solutions to meet these challenges.
There are six pillars into which we can organize the work of building capacity for data initiatives in civil society.</description></item><item><title>Values and Principles</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/values/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/values/</guid><description>When we think of the independent sector, we think of people and organizations outside the influence of politics and the market that offer additional and alternative services that carry our values. These values include the support of minority perspectives and needs, are fundamentally pluralistic.
Values of civil society
care kinship mutualism justice speak to power dignity participiation pluralism equity These values point towards a safer, fairer, and more just society for everyone.</description></item><item><title>Building Capacity</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/building_capacity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/building_capacity/</guid><description>When we speak of building capacity in the sector, we refer to strengthening the institutions, approaches, and methods by which these data initiatives might be more successful, less harmful, and provide sustained and meaningful benefit to society. We speak of addressing risks like the persecution of journalists, currupt funding, and misinformation in civil discourse. We speak of advancing and enabling the role of data, a leading role or a supporting role, in tackle the great problems of our time, such as the rise of authoritarianism and climate change.</description></item><item><title>Challenges</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/challenges/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/challenges/</guid><description>There are many challenges faced by civil society and its institutions. This discussion highlights just a few of those issues and focuses specifically on challenges to the responsible and effective use of data in the sector.
In the social sector, there is a higher bar for success than there is in other sectors. There is a greater need for fairness, accountability and transparency when working with vulnerable populations, in social services, and in domains such as criminal justice.</description></item><item><title>Opportunities</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/opportunities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/opportunities/</guid><description>Digital technologies and data tools are transforming civil society. They are changing the ways in which the independent sector operates, the way it is funded, and the relationships to organizations.
These changes create opportunities throughout the sector, and particularly for data products and initiatives as used in civil society organizations.
In my advisory and consulting work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to speak with dozens or hundreds of people and their teams about their aspirations for applying data.</description></item><item><title>What's different about civil society data initiatives?</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/garden/whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/garden/whats-different-about-civil-society-data-initiatives/</guid><description>Compared to those in other sectors, civil society&amp;rsquo;s data initiatives:
Are often multi-team collaborative efforts with a complexity of incentives and power-dynamics These are each different groups: the &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;data subject&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;stakeholder&amp;rdquo;. The purpose or role of data in the project may be fundamentally different Data sources must be treated as imperfect representations of reality Have different funding and sustainability models than we see in the private and public sectors.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/about/</guid><description>About Aman I share this information with the intent of finding and connecting with like-minded folks.

This definition usually includes academia, journalists, religious groups, NGOs, activists and nonprofits.
Note: Confusingly, the similar &amp;ldquo;civic sector&amp;rdquo; is used to refer to things related to the government or democratic participation especially by citizens. Here we are talking about civil and not civic.
Independence between these sectors can be critical, and provides an important counterbalance in society.</description></item><item><title>Global.health</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/globalhealth/</guid><description>Fenris worked with the Global.health leadership team to help align product development with long-term strategic objectives and to deliver value for the sector.
