<p> Hi all! We will meet at 11am today at Lake Merritt / Grand Lake Farmer's Market in Oakland. </p>

<div style="font-style: italic">No need to be on time! Check here for an updated location on November 23rd if you're having trouble finding the group!</div>

Update:

If you are walking from the market, turn right to walk around the lake counter clockwise. We are visible from the path.
