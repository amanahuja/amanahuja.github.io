      My own ideas on public goods and civil society are mere derivatives of Lucy's work. She led the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford, the impact of which will far exceed its own lifespan. She wrote the annual Blueprint, and regularly published ideas that have been invaluable resources to so many, year and after year. Our conversations have inspired me, and she's been so generous in connecting me to so many people in her network. Thank you, Lucy!

      Anya is a strategist and thinker that has long been my secret weapon. So many of my successes are due to her questioning and coaching. She has provided me tools that, through their use, have changed how I see the world.

      Positive social change faster than 20 years isn't about moving fast and breaking things. Eugene shows that the key is to improve how groups work together in complexity, and how to build the relevant skills through practice.
