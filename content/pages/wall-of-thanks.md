      My own ideas on digital goods and civil society are mere derivatives of Lucy's work and the many ideas that I've accessed through her writings. She led the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford, the impact of which will far exceeed its own lifespan. She wrote the annual Blueprint, and regularly published ideas that have been invaluable resources to me, year and after year. Our conversations have inspired me, and she's been so generous in connecting me to so many people in her network. Thank you, Lucy!

        Allen Gunn leads Aspiration and has been host, sponsor, and advisor to countless organizations at the intersection of technology and justice. As a practitioner he's challenged my notions of what is possible, and what is important. I am privileged to have regular conversations and occasional collaborations with him. I am proud to be associated with Gunner's organzaition and with AspirationTech.

        The first is the public sector or civic sector. Think of the government and the administrative and operational organizations required to run the government. In the CMA we're working with many public sector orgs, like the Michigan department of health and human services (MDHHS). Often we use the word civil to also reflect on the way we engage with government as constituents -- "civic engagement".

      Anya is a strategist and thinker that has long been my secret weapon. I cannot overstate how many of my successes are thanks to her listening, questioning and coaching. The tools that she has provided me are the kind that, through their use, have changed my ways of seeing the world.
