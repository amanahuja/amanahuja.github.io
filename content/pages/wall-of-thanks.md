      My own ideas on public goods and civil society are mere derivatives of Lucy's work. She led the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford, the impact of which will far exceed its own lifespan. She wrote the annual Blueprint, and regularly published ideas that have been invaluable resources to so many, year and after year. Our conversations have inspired me, and she's been so generous in connecting me to so many people in her network. Thank you, Lucy!

      Anya is a strategist and thinker that has long been my secret weapon. I cannot overstate how many of my successes are thanks to her listening, questioning and coaching. The tools that she has provided me are the kind that, through their use, have changed my ways of seeing the world.

      Making real change faster than the usual 20 years isn't about moving fast and breaking things. Eugene has shown us all that have to change fundamentals ways of working together, of true co-creation. That change takes practice. I use Eugene's ideas and frameworks now in every project.

       A long time colleague, Louis has been a though-partner and accountability buddy for many years. Louis inspires by <i>doing</i> where others talk.

        Gunner constantly challenges my notions of what is possible, and what is important. I am privileged by our collaborations and regular conversations, and to be associated with AspirationTech.
