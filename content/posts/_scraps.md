# Posts Scraps & Ideas

### Content for POSTS

Client-adjacent posts related to evaluating LLM-based products (companion pieces to 4-6 posts published with client editorial/PR)
Deeper dives or alternate framings that did not fit client publications
Serious experimental write-ups where artifacts (Marimo notebooks) support a clear insight
Reflective essays advancing an argument or synthesis

Posts must *mean something* - artifacts and narratives serve a claim, not the other way around.
