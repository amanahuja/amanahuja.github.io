Their tools leverage data and statistical models for public benefit. They bring critical new capabilities, and will grow to new users and geographies. They aim to be sustainable over their intended life cycle by assembling the right team and by achieving financial independence.


Three ideas are embedded in all my work and processes. 
First, the responsible use of data -- including collection of data, analytical methods, and data governance. 
Second, interdisciplinary and inclusionary teams at all levels. 
Third, a systems thinking analysis of intervention and impact.

      Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities
      to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike
      Flexbox, which is single-axis oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for
      2-dimensional layouts.
