# Notes Scraps & Ideas

### Content for NOTES

Early or partial write-ups of experiments with small language models
Exploratory reflections on work with LLM evaluation before polishing
Personal reflections and lineage (revisiting older anonymous blog posts)
Commentary on how thinking has changed (or not) over time
Archival material surfaced with or without new commentary

Notes do *not* need to be client-safe or fully formed. They exist to maintain momentum.
