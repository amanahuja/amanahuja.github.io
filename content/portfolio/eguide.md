The Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies (e-GUIDE) Initiative seeks to
transform the approaches used for planning and operations of electricity infrastructure in
developing regions. The Initiative brings together engineers and scientists from five leading
research institutions to build data analytics techniques to inform energy planning that are
scalable, transnational, and verified. The researchers partner with electricity service companies
to develop techniques, deploy them at scale, and build capacity for data and analytics in the
electricity sector. The project was funded by The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) Power Team with
support from the Foundationâ€™s Data Science Team.

I worked with the e-GUIDE team to set objectives, design an approach and implement a first version of their public-facing API.
