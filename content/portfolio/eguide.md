I worked with the Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies (e-GUIDE) Initiative to help set objectives, design an approach and implement a first version of their public-facing API.

### About the organization

e-GUIDE ([https://eguide.io](https://eguide.io))
> The Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies (e-GUIDE) Initiative seeks to transform the approaches used for planning and operations of electricity infrastructure in developing regions. 

> The Initiative brings together engineers and scientists from five leading research institutions to build data analytics techniques to inform energy planning that are scalable, transnational, and verified. The researchers partner with electricity service companies to develop techniques, deploy them at scale, and build capacity for data and analytics in the electricity sector.

This engagement was funded by The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) Power Team with support from the Foundationâ€™s Data Science Team.
