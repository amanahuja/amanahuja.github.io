This academic project involved lab analysis of liquid crystal mesogens for a lab a CU-Boulder and spin-off start up DisplayTech. I reflect on this project in [this blog post](/posts/liquid-crystals). 

In the summer of 2002, betweeen my sophomore and junior years of undergrad, I worked with the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Material Research Center (FLC-MRC) in Boulder. I spent most of my time conducting laboratory experiments to understand behavior of liquid crystal (LC) mesogens, seeking viable candidates for display applications. I created the cells, which were composed of a small sample of the LC on a glass slide in a specific physical configuration, and under a microscope I inspected the LC's phase transitions under applied temperature and electrical fields. I'll add a little more information about the science in the blog post linked above.

### About the organizations

**DisplayTech**
Displaytech was a startup that spun out of the FLC-MRC. The company specialized in using ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) microdisplays. At the time (early 2000s) their technology was impressive in achieving high resolution and very fast switching, and had applications in handheld digital cameras and in rear-projection TVs. The company was located in Longmont, Colorado. 

**FLC-MRC** - URL to Condensed Matter Laboratory
The Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Material Research Center (FLC-MRC) was located at the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was part of the Condensed Matter Laboratory in the dept of Physics.
