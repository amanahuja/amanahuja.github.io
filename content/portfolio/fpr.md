I helped New America, a US public policy think tank, to define objectives and roadmaps for a multi-stakeholder initiative that advances public discourse surrounding property rights insecurity and loss in the United States. My advisory work focused on helping the team scope and plan an initiative to develop regional indicators related to housing, land, and displacement.

The project involved extensive data collection and indicator development work focused on housing, evictions, and housing loss. We obtained consultations from experts throughout the country to ensure methodological rigor in addressing these politically sensitive and methodologically challenging economic indicators.
