In 2024, Fenris began working with the [World Resources Institute (WRI)](https://www.wri.org). WRI has always been an organization we've admired, as the home of some of the world's most important data products that are in the service of climate action and human well-being. 

We're proud and very excited to be partnering with WRI's Data Lab, which operates to support teams across the organozation and and runs an internal product studio, helping WRI teams develop new infrastructure, improved features, and completely new data products. Our collaboration focuses on strengthening their product and AI innovation capacity.

**Fenris is supporting the WRI Data Lab in three primary ways:**
* **AI Advising**: Providing strategic guidance on the responsible application of LLM and AI technologies across WRI initiatives
* **Prototype Evaluation**: Supporting evaluation of early-stage prototypes with users, including accuracy, usability, and impact
* **Collaborative Product Development**: Assisting in the development of high-impact data products with WRI teams across regions and sectors

Our role blends technical expertise with creativity and strategic insight to help WRI scale successful projects while ensuring sustainability, cost-efficiency, and technical success.
