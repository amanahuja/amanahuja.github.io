I led a team at The Data Guild in partnership with AGL, a major Australian power company, to develop and pilot a peer-to-peer residential energy trading platform in which users with rooftop solar and battery storage could trade excess energy with others in an automated marketplace.

First project phase: worked with our Australia-based client to understand the potential impact of peer to peer markets in the relevant space, and to design an MVP that would demonstrate technical and business feasibility. Second project phase: assembled a technical, design, and user research team to build a working MVP, deploy with a pilot population, and understand user reactions and motivations for the marketplace.

Served as a strategist and project manager through both phases, helping our team collaborate successfully internally and with our partner team at our client, a major energy generator and retailer.

On this project I served as a strategist and project manager through both phases, and led a combined team composed from the Guild, our client, and strategic partners.
