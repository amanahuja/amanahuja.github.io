In 2022, Fenris, along with Aspiration and Digital Public, launched a new
program on data leadership and governance. The Data Leadership Cohort was
designed to create opportunities for leaders to learn from peers about
governance, stewardship and long-term responsible leadership in data-centric
missions and ventures.

The Data Leadership Cohort brought together Aspiration’s field-leading and
tested frameworks for peer learning, Digital Public’s expertise in public
interest data governance, and practical expertise from Fenris for integrating
these ideas into team, process and product.

We believe this was the first opportunity of its kind, providing an opportunity
for emerging data leaders to meet, learn, and build connections with each other
as they work through challenges and opportunities in governing data
resources, designing data-intensive platforms, and procuring data systems.

### The Inaugural Cohort

{{< figure class="db mh0 w-50" src="/images/peer-learning-ico.png" alt="Covid-19 Modeling Accelerator splash image" >}}

The inaugural cohort was composed of a curated group of 7 brilliant leaders,
who participated in the program in the summer of 2022. Centered around a series
of practice-oriented sessions over three months, the group prototyped
structures and processes for effective data governance by workshopping each
other’s real-world cases.

The leaders partipating in the inaugural data leadership cohort were: 
* **Jessica Davison** -- Director of Learning, Analytics and Compliance, United Way of Greater Houston
* **Kelli Millwood Hill** -- Head of Data Insights, Khan Academy
* **Liam McMahon** -- Civic Engagement Coordinator, ISAIAH and Faith in Minnesota
* **Dr. Mark Olofson** -- Director of Educator Data, Research, and Strategy, Texas Education Agency
* **Matt Dawson** -- Senior Director of Efficacy & Implementation Research, Curriculum Associates
* **Vanessa Raymond** -- Program Manager, Strategic Initiatives, Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP)
* **Yotam Amit** -- The Movement Cooperative

The cohort was organized and facilitated by
* **Aman Ahuja** -- Founder, Fenris Network. 
* **Sean McDonald** -- Co-founder, Digital Public. 
* **Allen Gunn** -- Executive Director, Aspiration.

### Learnings and Next Steps

Find out what we learned from the program design process and the 2022 cohort,
and where the program will go next, in our upcoming series of posts. In these
short posts each of the organizers will share their reflections, and explore
feedback and outcomes from the cohort participants.
