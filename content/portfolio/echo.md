Fenris worked with Project ECHO to provide mentorship on product strategy, build metrics, and develop reusable assets for dashboards. 

Fenris collaborated with Project ECHO team on a needs assessment, data strategy discussions and metrics design. The initiative centered on two outcomes:  
* A set of high-level recommendations for the ECHO data and technology team
* The team worked together to plan, design and create a infographic “one-pager” that will be a new asset for ECHO moving forward.
