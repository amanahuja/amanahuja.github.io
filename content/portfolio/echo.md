**Project ECHO** - https://hsc.unm.edu/echo/
> The ECHO model was developed at the University of New Mexico and builds local communities around the world through a scalable learning framework.

Fenris collaborated with Project ECHO team on a needs assessment, data strategy discussions and metrics design. The initiative centered on two outcomes:  
* A set of high-level recommendations for the ECHO data and technology team
* The team worked together to plan, design and create a infographic “one-pager” that will be a new asset for ECHO moving forward.

This project was funded and supported by [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org) and Rockefeller Foundation (RF).
