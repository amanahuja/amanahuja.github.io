Capacity Building at Non Profits
February 2019

Panel theme (from the program)
> This panel discussion moderated by Kevin Miller from the Microsoft Cities Team, Kauser Razvi from Strategic Urban Solutions, Aman Ahuja a senior data consultant, and Kathryn Pettit from The Urban Institute. This session will explore the proper roles of organizations from different sectors, the various elements of capacity building that may lead to success, and how we might consider collectively moving toward large-scale improvement.

Key questions
* How should we be thinking about building basic data capacity and building capacity around more advanced skillsets and capabilities to handle things like machine learning, AI?  
* As we think about capacity building for in the civic space, what roles should the private sector, foundations, government and other civic actors play in helping to create capacity?  
* How can we scale up capacity building initiatives to really move the needle system wide?

* host and moderator [[Evan Tachovsky]]
* speakers [[Marisa Eisenberg]] and  [[Jon Zelner]]

Abstract: 
> During Covid-19, software developers across have scrambled to build tools to help policy makers and the public respond to the crisis. This session will explore high impact tools built by two teams: COVID Tracking Project and researchers at University of Michigan. The conversations will probe how the teams designed, developed, tested, and used their tools under time pressure and resource constraints, and explore the role of partners and users in software co-creatiotn.

# Data, Design and the Venture Studio: A New Model for Social Change
Presenters: Denise Gershbein + Aman Ahuja

## Description / Abstract
Today’s challenges - climate change, poverty, inequality, and others - are so complex and intertwined that there is rarely one solution or intervention that will make meaningful change. 
Denise and Aman have a combined 30+ years of working in design, data science and social change. Their work often achieves impact through “perturbing the system” - working at several levels at once to influence, build capacity, and release solutions that affect the system in multiple places, with a cascading effect. 
Today they do that work for The Data Guild, an impact-focused venture studio bringing together viewpoints from design and data science to bring about change in some of our greatest challenges, from local to global in scale.
Denise and Aman will discuss previous work with UNICEF Innovation, The Girl Effect, DataKind and others. They’ll also explain the working model for The Data Guild (part venture studio, consultancy, strategic partner and expert network) and why their team is making a bet that a systems-based approach is the key to impactful change.

Guest Lecture, Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)
Oct 2015

Guest speaking at the BIDS Data Science Lecture Series, I shared personal reflections on "real world" applications, historical development of some quantitative techniques, and the role of societal bias in statistical methods.
This lecture drew from the historical context in which analytical tools, like factor analysis, were created, and through this perspective introduced practical and ethical considerations to undergraduate students in the BIDS program. 

In this talk, Aman introduced practical and ethical considerations in data science application, approached from a historical context. I shared stories from my years of consulting, highlighting cases where real-world constraints led to a surprising result or creative solution. 

I was particularly interested in noting
* The history of data science as informing our current practices, including many questionable and even 
* Outliers and anomalies as subjects of importance and interest, rather than inconveniences to be filtered out. 

The lecture was supported by Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the Data, Society and Inference Seminar. The presentation was given at 190 Doe Library on UC Berkeley campus, the new location of the BIDS center.

Humanitarian AI Reading Group -- Addressing Ethical and Privacy Concerns in Data Products and Initiatives

Feb 28th 2019

Title: Addressing Ethical and Privacy Concerns in Data Products and Initiatives.

Abstract: Aman will lead a discussion on practical approaches to addressing ethical and privacy concerns in data products and initiatives. We'll talk about ways in which a practitioner might recognize these types of needs, and how they might be addressed. We will speak about specific tools available, and their limitations, as well as governance structures that can be created, such as data trusts.

"Downstream Retention of Mobile Financial Services in Kenya Uganda and Tanzania."
2016
Abstract: Using statistical modeling techniques we identify predictors of retention and differentiate between usage of services such as payments and loans on mobile devices. 

While initial findings are provided with caveats around data availability, we found age and education to be the primary demographic factors leading to retention. Conversely, gender was a poor predictor contrary to popular belief. Further analyses separates basic vs. sophisticated use of mobile financial services. 

A follow-up phase (including primary data collection) is warranted to confirm these findings and to move beyond basic demographics into more nuanced prediction and development of modeling tools useful to practitioners.

TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted; nor is it ever accidental. Indeed, beautifully typeset pages are always the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank of great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting stands apart from expressive artwork, because the appeal is not limited to a small circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment, and nowhere does this judgment carry more weight. Typography that cannot be read by everybody is useless. Even for someone who constantly ponders matters of readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether something can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at once when the type is too small or otherwise irritates the eye; both are signs of a certain illegibility already.

All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a smoothly running sentence or as an assembly of lines, which may even have contrasting shapes. Good typography begins, and this is no minor matter, with the typesetting of a single line of text in a book or a newspaper. Using exactly the same typeface, it is possible to create either a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is too wide or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
