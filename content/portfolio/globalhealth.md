Fenris worked with the Global.health leadership team to develop a multi-year strategy and product roadmap that translated their global mission into phased, fundable execution steps.

Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. The sequencing was carefully designed based on data readiness, governance requirements, and operating capacity of the organization.

Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, we created a *strategic product roadmap* with a three-year horizon that served as both an alignment tool and an investment signal for funders. This roadmap demonstrated Fenris's experience in developing a credible path from pilot project to durable civic asset.

These assets were developed over a 17-week engagement to be carried forward by product leads starting in 2022.

Additional support was provided through: 
* Product management and support of the engineering and development team
* Development of assets and training for user research as part of the G.h product development life-cycle
* Recommendations on engineering process and resourcing
