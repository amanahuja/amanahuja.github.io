Fenris worked with Global.health leadership team to help align product development with long-term strategic objectives and on delivering value for the sector. 

Our team helped G.h leaders refine a vision through a series of workshops. With the product team, we co-developed programs and objectives that were consistent with this vision and with constraints. Inviting input from advisors and stakeholders, a *strategic product roadmap* with a three-year horizon was drafted for G.h, and aligned with funding opportunities.

These assets were developed over a 17-week engagement to be carried forward by product leads starting in 2022.

Additional support was provided through: 
* Product management and support of the engineering and development team
* Development of assets and training for user research as part of the G.h product development life-cycle
* Recommendations on engineering process and resourcing
