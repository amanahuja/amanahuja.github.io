Fenris partnered with Litterati in 2023 to conduct comprehensive geospatial analysis of litter patterns across Europe, Africa, and South America. Working with stakeholders including the World Bank and Keep Britain Tidy, we transformed real-world litter observations into actionable data for environmental policy and waste management initiatives.

Our analysis characterized litter through systematic observation, capturing object types, materials, and brand information across diverse geographic regions. This data provided stakeholders with unprecedented insights into waste sources and the effectiveness of various intervention strategies.

**Fenris contributions:**
- Spatial sampling design and methodology
- Geospatial analysis and statistical modeling  
- Data visualization and dashboard development
- Stakeholder engagement and reporting

The project demonstrates how geospatial analysis can address global environmental challenges. By quantifying and visualizing litter distribution across diverse regions, we enabled stakeholders to make evidence-based decisions that advance sustainability goals and improve urban environments worldwide.

#### Impact

Our analysis directly influenced policy decisions related to waste management and environmental regulations, providing decision-makers with concrete data on litter distribution and composition. The work contributed to global efforts aimed at reducing litter and promoting sustainable waste management practices across multiple continents.
