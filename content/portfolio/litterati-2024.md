Litterati and Keep Britain Tidy Project 2024

In 2024, Fenris collaborated with Litterati and Keep Britain Tidy (KBT) to conduct a comprehensive geospatial analysis of litter distribution across the United Kingdom. The project focused on providing actionable insights to stakeholders for improving waste management policies and interventions.

In 2023, Fenris grew our partnership with Litterati to conduct geospatial analysis aimed to quantify litter in locations across Europe, Africa, and South America. The analysis and reports were instrumental in providing stakeholders with actionable data for policy and waste management initiatives.

With partners and clients, including World Bank and Keep Britain Tidy, this work aimed to better understand sources of waste, the impact of various interventions and waste management strategies. Our research was able to characterise litter through real-world observations, capturing litter object types, materials, and brands. 

Fenris contributions included spatial sampling design, geospatial analysis, data visualizations, and stakeholder engagement. 

This project exemplifies the use of geospatial analysis in addressing global environmental challenges. By quantifying and visualizing litter across diverse regions, we empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions that advance sustainability goals and improve urban environments worldwide.

#### Outcomes

We were able to provide decision-makers with actionable data on litter distribution and composition, influencing policy decisions related to waste management and environmental regulations.

This work contributed to efforts across the globe aimed at reducing litter and promoting sustainable waste management practices, impacting communities and environments worldwide.
