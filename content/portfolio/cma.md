A partnership of Rockefeller Foundation (RF), the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) and Fenris, the _COVID Modeling Accelerator_ offered modular packages of funding ($50k - $200k each) and technical assistance (including user research, product strategy, and UI design). This support was offered to academic modeling teams to create tools, dashboards, and insights for state and local decision makers and public health officials responding to COVID-19.

The team interviewed dozens of modeling teams and invited a set of candidates to apply. Fenris team members worked with candidates to help develop objectives and milestones, and to create a proposal in less than a month. 
Proposals were reviewed by SMDM, and the funds were administered via a vendor contract from Johns Hopkins University. Guidance was provided by the steering committee, which included members from RF, SMDM, and Fenris. The committee also helped determine allocation of technical assistance to the awardees. 

The data modeling teams were multi-disciplinary teams composed of epidemiologists, numerical modelers, experts in public health, operations research, and others. Some of the teams with which we worked were from: Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, University of Texas at Austin, Harvard / Massachusetts General Hospital, and University of Washington. We thank these teams for the opportunity to work with them and learn from them.
