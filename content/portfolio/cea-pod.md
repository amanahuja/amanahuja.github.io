The Data Guild ran a research "pod" to explore recent advancements in controlled environment agriculture. CEA has the potential to address areas of concern to the Guild: energy efficiency, human health, economic development, water and resource conservation, and climate resilience. 

The pod followed a structured methodology to understand the landscape of important players in this space, generate a simplified systems map, and to identify intersections with the Guild's strengths and related efforts. The pod members conducted interviews with experts and visited several CEA facilities. Among the outputs was several proposals for data products, each with a preliminary business canvas.
