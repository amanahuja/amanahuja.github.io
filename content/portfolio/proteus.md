The Data Guild advised on strategic approach to develop new market opportunities for a medical device company in the wearable space. One concept explored recovery cycle applications for professional athletes. Device interfaced with mobile device through an application with FDA regulatory considerations.

Our team also developed and tested the "recovery" calculation for the pilot, utilizing biometric data such as heart rate to calculate sleep and orthostatic stress conditions for individuals wearing the device.

This engagement focused on
* Industry and market gap analysis in a regulatory environment
* Product concept and business model canvas. 
* Proteus Recover pilot implementation
