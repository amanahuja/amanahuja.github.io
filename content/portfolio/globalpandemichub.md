Our client was a well-resourced and internationally recognized team working
with governments and major stakeholders around the world to create a digital
space that supports collaboration among the global epidemic intelligence community. 

The project's stated objective was to create
> "A digital environment where subject experts and the epidemic and pandemic
> intelligence community converge to communicate, cultivate ideas and
> co-develop, to rapidly generate and provide community-driven solutions to
> address existing challenges and needs in the domain of data, analytics, and
> evidence-based decision-making."

Through a short in-depth engagement, the Fenris team led a series of six
workshops with the team to help them align on vision, objectives, product
concept, and a three-year strategic roadmap.

We helped identify challenges and related them to the strengths of the team.
Co-created outputs included a draft plan for initial launch and a number
of re-usable assets. These assets were designed to empower the team with
frameworks and tools, helping at a formative stage to generate momentum
toward an upcoming launch and the public announcement of a long-term plan.

Fenris team leads: Aman Ahuja and Denise Gershbein.
