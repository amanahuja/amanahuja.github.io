Our client was a well-resourced and internationally recognized team working
with governments and major stakeholders around the world to create a digital
space that supports collaboration among the global epidemic intelligence community.

The project's stated objective was to create
> "A digital environment where subject experts and the epidemic and pandemic
> intelligence community converge to communicate, cultivate ideas and
> co-develop, to rapidly generate and provide community-driven solutions to
> address existing challenges and needs in the domain of data, analytics, and
> evidence-based decision-making."

Through a short, high-leverage engagement, the Fenris team led a series of six
workshops with the team to help align vision across stakeholders, funders, and executives
in an environment where incentives diverge and authority is diffuse.

We helped identify challenges and related them to the strengths of the team.
Co-created outputs included a draft plan for initial launch and a number
of re-usable assets. These assets were designed to empower the team with
internal frameworks and tools, helping at a formative stage to generate momentum
toward an upcoming launch and the public announcement of a long-term plan.

Fenris team leads: Aman Ahuja and Denise Gershbein.
