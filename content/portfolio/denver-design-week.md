Title: *"Data, Design and the Product Studio: A New Model for Social Change"* at Design Week 2018 in Denver Colorado.

Presenters: Denise Gershbein + Aman Ahuja

In this presentation at Design Week 2018 in Denver Colorado, Denise and Aman spoke about intersections between design and data paradigms, and on a model for the product studio focused on impact. 

**Abstract from the Design Week program**
> Denise and Aman have a combined 30+ years of working in design, data science and social change. Their work often targets impact through seeking levers in the system -- working at several levels at once to influence, build capacity, and release solutions that affect the system in multiple places, with a cascading effect. 

> Today they do that work for The Data Guild, an impact-focused Product studio bringing together viewpoints from design and data science to bring about change in some of our greatest challenges, from local to global in scale.

> Denise and Aman will discuss previous work with UNICEF Innovation, The Girl Effect, DataKind and others. Theyâ€™ll also explain the working model for The Data Guild (part product studio, consultancy, strategic partner and expert network) and why their team believes a systems-based approach is the key to impactful change.
