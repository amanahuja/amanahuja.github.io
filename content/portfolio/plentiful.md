Fenris partnered with Plentiful with our three-phase engagement model to strengthen their data strategy and expand their impact in charitable food
systems. Working closely with their leadership team, we focused on responsible data stewardship while developing new service offerings and platform concepts.                     
                                                                                                                                                                                  
Our engagement centered on two key initiatives: designing and analyzing a comprehensive survey of food-insecure individuals in New York City, and facilitating strategic alignment
workshops to guide Plentiful's data platform development and revenue diversification.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                  
**Key Projects:**                                                                                                                                                                 
- **Food Security Survey**: Helped design survey and the internal processes for analysis. This developed a new service offering. The first survey worked with Plentiful's partners and network in New York City. 
- **Denver Strategic Workshop**: Led a workshop to help align different team leads (from marketing, engineering, etc)  on concepts and roadmap for a data platform
- **Data Stewardship**: Advancing ideas around responsible stewardship, balancing values of transparency with privacy and dignity for Neighbors (food insecure individuals)

- Data visualization and reporting systems                                                                                                                                        
- Strategic facilitation and team alignment                                                                                                                                       
- Responsible data stewardship methodology                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                  
The project exemplified how thoughtful data strategy can advance social impact while maintaining ethical standards. By prioritizing the dignity and privacy of food-insecure individuals
throughout our analysis and platform design, we helped Plentiful build sustainable systems that respect their community while expanding their reach.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                  
#### Impact                                                                                                                                                                       
Our work enabled Plentiful to launch a new service offering with strong methodological foundations and established processes for ongoing survey analysis. The strategic alignment 
positioned the organization to develop platform concepts and explore new revenue channels while maintaining their core values around data stewardship and community
dignity.
