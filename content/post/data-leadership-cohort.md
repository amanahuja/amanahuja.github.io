### Overview

The Data Leadership Cohort 

The Data Leadership Cohort brings together Aspiration’s field-leading and tested frameworks for peer learning, Digital Public’s expertise in public interest data governance, and practical expertise from Fenris for integrating these ideas into team, process and product.

The first-ever Data Leadership Cohort is designed to provide an opportunity for emerging data leaders to meet, learn, and build connections with each other as they work through challenges and opportunities in governing data resources, designing data-intensive platforms, and procuring data systems.

We’re recruiting an initial cohort for a lightly facilitated and practice-oriented data governance peer learning group. Over the course of 8 weeks, a group of 8-12 data governance practitioners will focus on specific design components and requirements for effective data governance by work-shopping each others’ real-world cases.
