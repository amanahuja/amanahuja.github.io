I help teams translate research and tools into responsible and impactful data products. 

Through my network, Fenris, I bring together colleagues and experts to help my clients succeed. My teamâ€™s work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data & AI ethics, and managing power imbalances. 

In addition to data science and software development expertise, we help clients build their product strategy, technical roadmaps, and improve user adoption. We understand the importance of carefully constructed feedback loops and the delicate risk/benefit balance of outcome metrics. 

My focus is on civil society teams &#8212; non profits, academic and research teams, and foundations &#8212; seeking to improve reach, adoption, and financial independence of their data initiatives.
