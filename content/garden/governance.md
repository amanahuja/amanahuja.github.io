## Governance Frameworks

To address governance issues for a specific data initiative we need to understand: 
* The policy landscape as it relates to the initiative.
* The regulatory environment
* The ethical issues and approaches to address them
* Power imbalances, especially in stakeholder and funder relationships

We see governance as a process, rather than a set of rules or agreements. It must continually evolve, and be able to address new and unanticipated questions. It must be sustainable over relevant periods of time, which means that it must remain relevant and empowered.
