## Challenges faced by Civil Society data initiatives

When we speak of building capacity in the sector, we refer to strengthening the institutions, approaches, and methods by which these data initiatives might be more successful, less harmful, and provide sustained and meaningful benefit to society. We speak of addressing risks like prosecution of journalists, currupt funding, and misinformation in civil discourse. We speak of the role, a leading role or a supporting role, that data might play in the way we tackle the great problems of our time, such as the rise of authoritarianism and climate change. 


In the social sector, there is a higher bar for success, not a lower one. There is a greater need for fairness, accountability and transparency than in other sectors. The cost of failure is higher, and incrementalism can be more damaging than beneficial. 


To improve outcomes for these types of data product initiatives, civil society must not just meet standards set by the private sector, it will have to surpass them.
