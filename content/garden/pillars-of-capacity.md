The sector has long recognized ways in which it is different from the private and government sector. It has its own perspective on how efforts should be selected and grown and sustained. It has its own measures of success, and its sets of principles and best practices. The use of data, specifically, presents unique [opportunities](opportunities.md) and [challenges](challenges.md) to civil society. 

When we speak of building capacity in the sector, we refer to strengthening the institutions, approaches, and methods by which these data initiatives might be more successful, less harmful, and provide sustained and meaningful benefit to society. We speak of addressing risks like prosecution of journalists, currupt funding, and misinformation in civil discourse. We speak of the role, a leading role or a supporting role, that data might play in the way we tackle the great problems of our time, such as the rise of authoritarianism and climate change.

There are six pillars into which we can organize this work of building capacity for data initiatives in civil society. These Six Pillars are: 
1. [Healthy Life-cycles](healthy-life-cycles.md)
2. [Sustainable Models](sustainable-models.md)
3. [Governance](governance.md)
4. [Ecosystem / Network](ecosystem-network.md)
5. [Digital Infrastructure](digital-infrastructure.md)
6. [Empowered Leaders](empowered-leaders.md)
