Welcome to my garden! (A digital garden is a kind of personal wiki.)

At the center of this section are the [Six Pillars](pillars-of-capacity.md) that I suggest will strengthen data initiatives in [civil society](why-is-civil-society-important.md). Motivation is provided by a description of the [challenges faced](challenges.md) and [opportunities before us](opportunities.md). Guiding the work that we do in this space are the underlying [principles](principles.md). Together this lays a vision for how we can work towards our [desired future](desired_future_state.md) state.
