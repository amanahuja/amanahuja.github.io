Welcome to my garden! (A digital garden is a kind of personal wiki.)

At the center of this section are the [Six Pillars](pillars-of-capacity.md) that I suggest will strengthen data initiatives in [civil society](why-is-civil-society-important.md). Motivation is provided by a description of the [challenges faced](challenges.md) and [opportunities before us](opportunities.md). Guiding the work that we do in this space are the underlying [principles](principles.md). Together this lays a vision for how we can work towards our [desired future](desired_future_state.md) state.

On each page I will provide the key ideas, examples to help illustrate the concepts, and references to further reading on the topic.

Lost? A great place to start is ["Why is civil society important?"](why-is-civil-society-important.md).

*This area is experimental and a work in progress. Feedback on form or content is very welcome, as are direct contributions, which can be made through the [github repo](https://github.com/amanahuja/amanahuja.github.io/tree/main/content/garden).*
