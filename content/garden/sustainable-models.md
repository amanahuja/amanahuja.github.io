Sustainability means, of course, financial sustainability, but also many other factors that determine the ability of an data initiative to remain successful and continue to provide value or deliver impact, for the intended duration. 

Many projects are designed as experimental, or short term by nature, requiring an initial infusion of resources for a pre-determined duration, usually 3 years or less. In fact, most efforts are intentionally designed in this way. This is sometimes appropriate, and can help launch and derisk new approaches. But having this be a default mode of operation and intention leads to many problems for civil society as a whole.

Some of the reasons a data initiative may not sustain for its intended duration are: 
* **Funding runs out**, and the team is unable to secure new funding. 
* **Team members leave the project**. This type of instability can be caused by lack of career options for the team, poor or insufficient leadership, or simply because students graduate. Bus factor risk can exacerbate the impact of team turnover.
* **Leaders lose interest**. Inventive structures and motivation are skewed towards innovation and building, especially for leaders in academic institutions. Many leaders aren't interested or well-suited to managing teams, sustaining operations. 
* **Takeover**: The organization or project is absorbed, usually by a funder or sponsor. This can be subtle, as when board seats are captured to redirect resources. 
* The **absence or instability of legal structure** can be the downfall of initiatives. For example, when the initiative has no clear owner, or when there are problems in attaining desired legal status and fiscal sponsorship.

There are good reasons for an initiative to shut down, of course. It may have achieved its stated purpose. Or it may be unsuccessful due to an incorrect theory of change, or have become irrelevant. Whatever the cause, there are important considerations at the end of a data initiative [lifecycle](healthy-life-cycles.md).
