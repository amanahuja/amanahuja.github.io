My clients are on a journey of translating research and a vision into successful tools. Their tools leverage data and statistical models for public benefit. They bring critical new capabilities, and will grow to new users and geographies. They can be made sustainable over their intended life cycle by assembling the right team and by achieving financial independence.

I work with public benefit corporations, non profits, academic research teams, or foundations. These organizations are often part of a civil-public or civil-private collaboration, in sectors such as health and energy.  

My work is driven by three ideals.  
First, the responsible use of data -- including collection of data, analytical methods, and data governance. 
Second, in interdisciplinary and inclusionary teams at all levels. 
Third, in a systems thinking analysis of intervention and impact.
