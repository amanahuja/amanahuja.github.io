I help teams translate research and tools into responsible and impactful data products. 

My focus is on civil society (non profit, academic) teams seeking to improve reach, adoption, and financial independence. Through my network, [Fenris]("#"), I bring together colleagues and experts to help my clients succeed. My teamâ€™s work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data & AI ethics, and managing power imbalances. 

In addition to data science and software development expertise, we help clients build their product strategy, technical roadmaps, and improve user adoption. We understand the importance of carefully constructed feedback loops and the delicate risk/benefit balance of outcome metrics. 

The initiatives with which we work often involve partnerships between funders, public sector (government), and private sector stakeholders. Good data governance plays an important role in making these partnerships successful.
