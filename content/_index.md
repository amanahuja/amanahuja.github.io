I help teams translate research and tools into responsible and impactful data products. 

My work is rooted in systems thinking, responsible data, and social impact. I work with values-aligned client teams of all sizes and in sectors such as health care and energy. :: [Manifesto]("/manifesto").

Although I often work independently, for most projects I either join or assemble a team of data scientists, strategists, engineers, designers and SMEs. :: [Network]("/network/")

My focus is on civil society teams &#8212; non profits, academic and research teams, and foundations &#8212; seeking to improve reach, adoption, and financial independence of their data initiatives. :: [Civil Society]("/civil_society/")
