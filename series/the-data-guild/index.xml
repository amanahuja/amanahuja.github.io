CEA has the potential to address areas of concern to the Guild: energy efficiency, human health, economic development, water and resource conservation, and climate resilience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pod followed a structured methodology to understand the landscape of important players in this space, generate a simplified systems map, and to identify intersections with the Guild&amp;rsquo;s strengths and related efforts. The pod members conducted interviews with experts and visited several CEA facilities. Among the outputs was several proposals for data products, each with a preliminary business canvas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Platform for Clinical Trials</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/acamar-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Guild worked with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world to develop a new approach to data sharing in clinical research. The immediate objective was to decrease the time and increase the efficiency of clinical trials. We developed design principles that centered openness, transparency, and improved outcomes for patients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach centered an open technical platform with independent governance to guarantee the compliance, quality, and interoperability of software offerings in clinical trials. By working at the center of clinical data systems and their partners, the Guild identified a range of new data- and AI-enabled clinical research capabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Platform</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/p2p-energy-trading/</guid><description>&lt;p>A working peer-to-peer residential energy trading marketplace helped us understand user pains, preconceptions and motivations for trading excess energy with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I led a team at The Data Guild in partnership with AGL, a major Australian power company, to develop and pilot a peer-to-peer residential energy trading platform in which users with rooftop solar and battery storage could trade excess energy with others in an automated marketplace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first phase of this project we worked with our Australia-based client to understand the potential impact of peer to peer markets in the relevant space, and to design an MVP that would demonstrate technical and business feasibility. In the second phase, we assembled a technical, design, and user research team to build a working MVP, deploy with a pilot population, and understand user reactions and motivations for the marketplace.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proteus Digital Health</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/proteus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/proteus/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Data Guild advised on strategic approach to develop new market opportunities for a medical device company in the wearable space. One concept explored recovery cycle applications for professional athletes. Device interfaced with mobile device through an application with FDA regulatory considerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our team also developed and tested the &amp;ldquo;recovery&amp;rdquo; calculation for the pilot, utilizing biometric data such as heart rate to calculate sleep and orthostatic stress conditions for individuals wearing the device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EnergySavvy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/energysavvy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/energysavvy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Data Guild helped develop and assess models and key performance indicators (KPIs) for energy usage. Designed methods to measure change after some event (causal inference) using counter-factuals, and corresponding uncertainty. Provided strategic direction and best practices related to code, machine learning systems, and parallelizing analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Benchmarked against the ASHRAE 14 definition of savings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New definition of energy savings based on counterfactuals &amp;amp; building models&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Machine learning (ML) pipeline parallelization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technologies utilized: python and scikit tools, starcluster spot instances on AWS compute.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aman designed the ML pipeline and parallelization, implementing the savings calculation at scale. I worked with the team to assess our new savings calculation against the benchmark standard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>C3 Energy</title><link>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amanahuja.me/portfolio/c3energy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Data Guild consulted on the development of a malfunction and theft detection system for energy utility providers. The client&amp;rsquo;s analytics engine enabled petabyte=scale grid data aggregation of historical and operational data, including smart-meter data, billing and service history, and various metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our approach built on work by a team from Berkeley, innovating using a bagging and unsupervised support vector machine (SVM).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technologies utilized included python-based libraries (pandas, sklearn, etc) on AWS-based parallel computation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aman&amp;rsquo;s role was as a senior machine learning consultant. I helped design and implement the approach, identifying and ranking potential theft sites.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
